I am Thomas Bourany. Currently student in the Research Master "Mathematics of Modelling" at the UPMC-Sorbonne University, I specialize in control theory, numerical methods for Mean Field Games and their applications to economics. I am intern in LJLL at the University Paris-Diderot  under the supervision of Y. Achdou for the summer 2018.

Previously graduated in Economics from Sciences Po Paris, Ecole Polytechnique and ENSAE (EPP master), I will start the MAPSS (MA Program in Social Sciences) -- Economics at the University of Chicago in September 2018. I am mainly interested in macroeconomics and the implications of agent heterogeneity for monetary and fiscal policies.
