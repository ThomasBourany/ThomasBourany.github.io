I'm Thomas Bourany. Currently student in the Research Master "Mathematics of Modelling", I specialize in control theory and numerical methods for Mean Field Games and their applications to economics.

Previously graduated in Economics in Sciences Po Paris, Ecole Polytechnique and ENSAE (EPP master), I will start the MAPSS (MA Program in Social Sciences) -- Economics in September 2018 at University of Chicago. I am mainly interested in macroeconomics and the implications of agent heterogeneity for monetary and fiscal policies.
