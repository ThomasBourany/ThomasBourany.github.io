I am Thomas Bourany, graduated in Mathematics and Economics and Teaching Assistant in Economics at Sciences Po since 2015.

Currently ending a Research Master -- "Mathematics of Modeling" -- at the UPMC-Sorbonne University, I specialize in stochastic control theory and numerical methods for Mean Field Games. I am intern in LJLL at the University Paris-Diderot under the supervision of Y. Achdou for the summer 2018. I develop novel mathematical methods for economic models (heterogeneous agents model with aggregate risk).

Previously graduated in a master in Economics from Sciences Po Paris, Ecole Polytechnique and ENSAE (EPP master), I will start the MAPSS (MA Program in Social Sciences) -- Economics at the University of Chicago in September 2018. I am mainly interested in macroeconomics and the implications of agent heterogeneity for monetary and fiscal policies.  

I am looking for a Research Assistantship position on one of these topics for the year 2018-2019.
