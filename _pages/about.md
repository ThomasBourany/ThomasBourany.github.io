<div style="text-align: justify"> 
I am Thomas Bourany, PhD candidate at the University of Chicago. I specialize in macroeconomics, more specifically in the field of heterogeneous agents models using methods borrowed from the Mean Field Games mathematical literature. <br/>  <br/>

Graduated from two research masters, "Mathematics of Modeling" from the UPMC-Sorbonne University, and a master in Economics from Sciences Po Paris, Ecole Polytechnique and ENSAE "EPP master", I have also been Teaching Assistant at SciencesPo since 2015 and UChicago since 2019. <br/>  <br/>
