I am Thomas Bourany, PhD candidate at the University of Chicago. I specialize in macroeconomics, more specifically in the field of heterogeneous agents models using methods borrowed from the Mean Field Games mathematical literature. 

Graduated from two research masters, "Mathematics of Modeling" from the UPMC-Sorbonne University, and a master in Economics from Sciences Po Paris, Ecole Polytechnique and ENSAE "EPP master", I have also been Teaching Assistant at SciencesPo and UChicago since 2015.
