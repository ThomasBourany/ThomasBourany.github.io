<div style="text-align: justify"> 

With other graduate students from UChicago -- with the great Léo ! among others -- we organize a small scale Macro reading group. This aims at understanding the recent literature in theoretical and applied macroeconomics that was discussed in seminars but not really discussed in PhD classes.  <br/>  <br/>

We usually meet on **Wednesday at 5:30** in room 419 of Saieh Hall of Economics, and organize usually one hour talk with:  <br> 
- an introduction to a field, with the aim of understanding the approaches of different authors/papers
- a specific important/classical paper to be covered in details
We plan to cover various topics, including Heterogenous Agents Macro, Growth, Trade, Finance, Urban/Spatial Economics, Public Finance, IO, etc. The slides of these meeting are uploaded below. Feel free to send me an email if you wish to participate! <br/>  <br/>

# First meeting - January, 15 : Thomas Bourany <br> 
I covered heterogeneous agents models and different methods to handle aggregate shocks. In particular, I briefly described the articles by Krusell-Smith (1998), Reiter (2009), Boppart-Krusell-Mitman 2018, and if time permits some extensions of these (Ahn, Kaplan, Moll, Winberry and Wolf (2018) or Auclert, Bardóczy, Rognlie and Straub (2019)). The slides are <a href='https://thomasbourany.github.io/files/W1_TBourany_HA_AggShocks.pdf' style="color:blue">here</a>. <br/>  <br/>

# Second meeting - January, 22 : Leo Aparisi De Lannoy  <br> 
L\'eo covered optimal policies in heterogeneous agents models. He discussed extensively
Nuno and Moll (2018, RED) and made some comments on Nuno and Thomas (2019), and Bhandari-Evans-Golosov-Sargent (2018). The slides are <a href='https://thomasbourany.github.io/files/W2_LAParisiDeLannoy_HA_OptimalPolicy.pdf' style="color:blue">here</a>. <br/>  <br/>

# Third meeting - February, 5 : Aleksei Oskolkov  <br> 
Alex will cover models with variable mark-ups and nested CES, in the spirit of Atkeson and Burstein (2008). The slides will be uploaded  <a href='https://thomasbourany.github.io/files/W3_AOskolkov_NestedCES.pdf' style="color:blue">here</a>. <br/>  <br/>

Fourth meeting - February, 19 : TBD  <br>
