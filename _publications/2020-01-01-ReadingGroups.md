<div style="text-align: justify"> 

With other graduate students from UChicago - the great Léo ! among others - we organize a small scale macro reading group. This aims at understanding the recent literature in theoretical and applied macroeconomics usually discussed in seminars but not really covered in PhD classes.  <br/>  <br/>

We usually meet on <b> Wednesday at 5:30 </b> in room 419 of the Saieh Hall of Economics, and organize usually one hour talk with:  <br> 
<ul>
<li> an introduction to a field, to understand and compare the approaches of different authors/papers
<li> a specific important/classical paper to be covered in details 
</ul>
We plan to cover various topics, including Heterogenous Agents Macro, Growth, Trade, Finance, Urban/Spatial Economics, Public Finance, IO, etc. The slides of these meetings are uploaded below. Feel free to send an email if you wish to participate! <br/>  <br/>

<h1> <b> First meeting - January, 15 : Thomas Bourany </b> </h1>  
I covered heterogeneous agents models and different methods to handle aggregate shocks. In particular, I briefly described the articles by Krusell-Smith (1998), Reiter (2009), Boppart-Krusell-Mitman 2018, and if time permits some extensions of these (Ahn, Kaplan, Moll, Winberry and Wolf (2018) or Auclert, Bardóczy, Rognlie and Straub (2019)). The slides are <a href='https://thomasbourany.github.io/files/W1_TBourany_HA_AggShocks.pdf' style="color:blue">here</a>. <br/>  <br/>

<h1> <b> Second meeting - January, 22 : Léo Aparisi De Lannoy </b> </h1>  
Léo covered optimal policies in heterogeneous agents models. He discussed extensively
Nuno and Moll (2018, RED) and made some comments on Nuno and Thomas (2019), and Bhandari-Evans-Golosov-Sargent (2018). The slides are <a href='https://thomasbourany.github.io/files/W2_LAParisiDeLannoy_HA_OptimalPolicy.pdf' style="color:blue">here</a>. <br/>  <br/>

<h1> <b> Third meeting - February, 5 : Aleksei Oskolkov  </b> </h1> <br> 
Alex will cover models with variable mark-ups and nested CES, in the spirit of Atkeson and Burstein (2008). The slides will be uploaded  <a href='https://thomasbourany.github.io/files/W3_AOskolkov_NestedCES.pdf' style="color:blue">here</a>. <br/>  <br/>
