This project is part of my internship at Paris-Diderot University, under the supervision of Yves Achdou. 

The standard economic framework with "heterogeneous agents" -- the Aiyagari-Bewley model -- has recently been reformulated as an example of Mean Field Game (MFG), by Achdou, Han, Lasry, Lions and Moll (2018). One of the key question in this type of model is to understand the transmission effects of aggregate shocks - on aggregate macro variables and on the shape of the wealth distribution. Such framework can thus be understood as a MFG with "common noise".

To handle this intricate problem, we simulate this model with a finite number of shocks, using specific finite-differences methods. We adapt these methods to solve the Krusell and Smith (1998) model, an extension with endogenous labor supply, the standard HANK (Heterogeneous Agents New Keynesian model) and the

In these <a href='https://thomasbourany.github.io/files/Pres_MFG_MiMh.pdf' style="color:blue">slides </a>, I provide an introduction to the mathematical literature of Mean Field Games, an overview of the article by Achdou, Han, Lasry, Lions and Moll (2018) and I describe a preliminary version of the project when introducing aggregate shocks.

In this <a href='https://thomasbourany.github.io/files/Rapport Thomas Bourany_v1.pdf' style="color:blue">report </a>, I provide a complete description of the numerical methods implemented for the Krusell Smith model.
