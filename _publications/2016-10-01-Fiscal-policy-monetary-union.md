This paper is an updated version of master thesis written in 2016, for the Economic master EPP (Economics and Public Policy), under the supervision of Jean-Baptiste Michau (Ecole Polytechnique). In this master thesis, I explored the role of government spending, the optimal policy design and the various spillovers of public spending shocks in a monetary union. Through this New Keynesian theoretical model, when countries are heterogeneous, I could formulate a rationale for Fiscal-Monetary cooperation.

*Abstract*
<i> What are the effects of fiscal policy in a monetary union? This article explores the role of government spending, the optimal policy design and the various spillovers of public spending shocks in an integrated union. To this purpose, we develop a two-countries model with "large economies", updating the conclusions at stake in "small open economy" models, and providing a general framework where countries differ on many aspects -- home-bias, agents preferences, price rigidities and labor supply. We first show that interaction effects and structural heterogeneity matter for optimal policy: the clear separation between central bank stabilizing the union and fiscal policies stabilizing country-specific shocks will not hold in this setting. Our second set of results is to identify the main transmission mechanisms of fiscal policy, with first a trade channel, through relative prices, and second a monetary response from the union central bank. Our main conclusion is that spillovers of fiscal policy shocks crucially depend on the central bank mandate and the second channel largely dominates the first in this setting. This framework provides arguments supporting coordination between union central bank and fiscal authorities in the context of the European Monetary Union. </i>
