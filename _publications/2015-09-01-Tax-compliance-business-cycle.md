This work is the result of my Research Assistantship at the French Central Bank (Banque de France -- DGEI-DERIE-SEMSI), under the supervision of researchers F. Pappad\'a and Y. Zylberberg. We constructed a new indicator for tax compliance and studied empirically fiscal policy over the business cycle. I was in charge of the data collection and the statistical analysis, and I received for this work the <i>Prize for the Research Internship</i> from Ecole Polytechnique.

This work is the object of further research.

The database constructed in this project was used in the article by F. Pappad\'a and Y. Zylberberg. For more details, <a href='https://sites.google.com/site/francescopappada/austerity' style="color:blue">see here</a>.
