This project is part of my internship at Paris-Diderot University (LJLL), under the supervision of Yves Achdou and constitutes my Master Thesis in Mathematics at UPMC-Sorbonne (M2 - Mathematics of Modelling). <br/>  <br/>


The standard economic framework with "heterogeneous agents" -- the Aiyagari-Bewley-Huggett model -- has recently been reformulated as an example of Mean Field Game (MFG), by Achdou, Han, Lasry, Lions and Moll (2018). One of the key question in this type of model is to understand the transmission effects of aggregate shocks - on aggregate macro variables and on the shape of the wealth distribution. Such framework can thus be understood as a MFG with "common noise". <br/>  <br/>

It is known that the introduction of common noise (aggregate shocks) poses great challenges, both mathematically and computationally. To handle these intricate problems, we simulate this model with a finite number of shocks, and solving the deterministic model between each shock using finite-differences methods. We adapt these methods to solve (i) the Krusell and Smith (1998) model, (ii) an extension with endogenous labor supply, (iii) the standard HANK (Heterogeneous Agents New Keynesian model) with one asset and we provide intuitions for (iv) the two-assets model HANK model from Kaplan Moll and Violante (2017).  <br/>  <br/>

In these <a href='https://thomasbourany.github.io/files/Pres_MFG_MiMh.pdf' style="color:blue">slides</a>, I provide an introduction to the mathematical literature of Mean Field Games, an overview of the article by Achdou, Han, Lasry, Lions and Moll (2018) and I describe a preliminary version of the project when introducing aggregate shocks.<br/>  <br/>


In this <a href='https://thomasbourany.github.io/files/MasterThesis_ThomasBourany_MFGwCommonNoise.pdf' style="color:blue">long version of my Master Thesis</a> (80 pages), I provide a complete description of the mathematical framework, the numerical methods to approximate the aggregate shocks and implementation for the Krusell Smith model (i) and its extensions (ii)-(iv). <br/>  <br/>

In this <a href='https://thomasbourany.github.io/files/MasterThesis_ThomasBourany_MFGwCommonNoise_short.pdf' style="color:blue"> shorter article version </a> (25 pages) I only present the method applied to the Krusell Smith model. 

In these <a href='https://thomasbourany.github.io/files/W1_TBourany_HA_AggShocks' style="color:blue">slides</a>, I describe briefly the different algorithms -- developed in the computational economics literature -- to handle heterogeneous agents models with aggregate shocks (i.e. MFG with common noise).
